        <h1 id="Washington-State-Gambling-Earnings-Regulations-Released"><a href="#Washington-State-Gambling-Earnings-Regulations-Released" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Gambling Earnings Regulations Released"></a>Washington State Gambling Earnings Regulations Released</h1><p>On Wednesday, the Washington State Gambling Commission released its annual report on gambling earnings. The report found that the state earned over $1.02 billion in gambling taxes and fees last year. This is a 5% increase from the $970 million generated in 2017.</p>
<p>The majority of the revenue came from tribal casinos, which accounted for $874 million or 85% of all earnings. Lotteries were the next biggest earners, bringing in almost $142 million. This was followed by racetracks and card clubs, which generated just over $11 million and $3 million respectively.</p>
<p>The gambling commission attributed the increase to continued growth in tribal casino revenue and the expansion of legal gambling options in the state. They also highlighted the importance of providing responsible gaming options and education to protect consumers.</p>
<p>Gambling has long been an important part of Washington’s culture and economy. With over two dozen tribes operating casinos, it is one of the most heavily gambled states in the country. In addition to generating significant tax revenue, tribal casinos also provide employment and support to local communities.</p>
<p>While there have been concerns about gambling addiction and its impact on families, overall the industry has been a positive force for the state. With revenues continuing to grow, it looks like this will continue to be the case for years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Clarifies-Gambling-Tax-Rules"><a href="#Washington-Clarifies-Gambling-Tax-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Washington Clarifies Gambling Tax Rules"></a>Washington Clarifies Gambling Tax Rules</h1><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Internal Revenue Service has announced new rules for the taxation of gambling winnings and losses. The clarification comes after a series of questions from taxpayers and tax professionals regarding the taxation of winnings from lotteries, casinos, and other gambling activities.</p>
<p>The new rules state that all gambling winnings are taxable income, and must be reported on your tax return. This includes winnings from lotteries, casinos, horse races, and other wagers. Gambling losses can be deducted as an itemized deduction on your tax return, but only to the extent of your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>For example, if you have $1,000 in gambling winnings and $500 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $500 of your losses on your tax return. If you have $5,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in gambling losses, you can’t deduct any of your losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>The new rules also clarify that playing poker or other card games for money is considered gambling activity. You must report all of your poker winnings as taxable income, even if you don’t receive a Form W-2G showing the amount of the winning. However, you can’t deduct any of your poker losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>The IRS also issued guidance regarding the taxation of state lottery prizes. The guidance states that state lottery prizes are always taxable income, regardless of whether the prize is paid in a lump sum or over time. State lottery commissions are required to report the full amount of any prize over $600 to the IRS and to the winner.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-The-Rules-On-Declaring-Gambling-Earnings-In-Washington-State"><a href="#What-Are-The-Rules-On-Declaring-Gambling-Earnings-In-Washington-State" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Rules On Declaring Gambling Earnings In Washington State?"></a>What Are The Rules On Declaring Gambling Earnings In Washington State?</h1><p>If you are a Washington State resident who has earned income from gambling, you must report this income on your state tax return. The good news is that gambling losses can be deducted from the income you report, so long as you itemize your deductions.</p>
<p>There are specific rules that apply to gambling income and deductions, so it is important to understand what is required in order to properly report your earnings. Here is a breakdown of the basics: </p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casinos, as well as payments for services rendered as a professional gambler. </li>
<li>Gambling losses can only be deducted if they are incurred in the same year as the gambling income is reported. </li>
<li>You can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income. </li>
<li>Gambling winnings are considered taxable income and must be reported regardless of whether they are distributed or not. </li>
<li>You must have documentation to support any gambling losses you claim on your tax return. This could include items like receipts, tickets, or other proof of payment. </li>
<li>Professional gamblers should keep track of their net winning or losing streak during the year to help determine if they have met the criteria for gambling gains/losses”.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-To-Declare-Gambling-Winnings-In-Washington-State"><a href="#How-To-Declare-Gambling-Winnings-In-Washington-State" class="headerlink" title="How To Declare Gambling Winnings In Washington State"></a>How To Declare Gambling Winnings In Washington State</h1><p>If you are a Washington State resident and you’ve won money while gambling, you may be wondering how to report those winnings on your state tax return. Luckily, the process is relatively simple.</p>
<p>To declare your gambling winnings, you will need to complete IRS Form 1040, Schedule 1. On this form, you will report both your gambling income and losses.</p>
<p>Gambling income includes not only the amount of money that you won while gambling, but also any prizes or awards that you received as a result of your gambling activities. This can include things like free hotel rooms or meals that were provided to you by the casino.</p>
<p>In order to report your gambling losses, you will need to keep track of all of your wagers and subtract them from your winnings. You can deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you had $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you would only be able to deduct $1,000 on your tax return.</p>
<p>Washington State does not have a specific deduction for gambling losses, but you can still claim this deduction on your federal tax return. To do so, you will need to complete IRS Form 4797. This form is used to report gains and losses from sources such as stocks, bonds, and yes – gambling income.</p>
<p>When filing your federal tax return, be sure to use the same method for reporting your gambling income and losses that you use on your Washington State tax return. This will help ensure that everything is reported correctly.</p>
<p>For more information on how to report gambling income and losses in Washington State, visit the Washington State Department of Revenue website or consult with a qualified tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Updates-Rules-For-Gambling-Income"><a href="#Washington-Updates-Rules-For-Gambling-Income" class="headerlink" title="Washington Updates Rules For Gambling Income"></a>Washington Updates Rules For Gambling Income</h1><p>The state of Washington has released updates to the rules governing how gambling income is taxed. The new rules go into effect on January 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Under the old rules, gambling income was taxable as regular income. This meant that taxpayers would have to pay taxes on winnings at their regular tax rate.</p>
<p>The new rules allow taxpayers to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income. This means that taxpayers who suffer losses can offset those losses against any gambling winnings they may have.</p>
<p>The new rules also create a separate category for gambling income. This means that gambling income will be taxed at a different rate than regular income. The exact tax rate will depend on the amount of gambling income earned in a year.</p>
<p>Washington is the first state in the country to adopt these updated rules. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.</p>
