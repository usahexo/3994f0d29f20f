        <h1 id="Las-Vegas-Sands-to-Own-New-York-City-MLS-Team"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Sands-to-Own-New-York-City-MLS-Team" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Sands to Own New York City MLS Team"></a>Las Vegas Sands to Own New York City MLS Team</h1><p>The ownership group of Las Vegas Sands, led by billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has announced plans to own a Major League Soccer team in New York City. This would make them the first casino company to own a professional sports franchise.</p>
<p>Adelson is no stranger to soccer. He is the owner of Israeli club Beitar Jerusalem and has been a big supporter of the game in Israel. His involvement in MLS would be another move towards making soccer a bigger sport in the United States.</p>
<p>The New York City expansion bid is one of four currently under consideration by MLS. The other bidders include groups from Miami, Minneapolis, and Sacramento. The decision on who will be awarded the expansion team is expected to be made later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Madison-Square-Garden-Company-and-Anschutz-Entertainment-Group-to-Join-Forces-in-Los-Angeles"><a href="#Madison-Square-Garden-Company-and-Anschutz-Entertainment-Group-to-Join-Forces-in-Los-Angeles" class="headerlink" title="Madison Square Garden Company and Anschutz Entertainment Group to Join Forces in Los Angeles"></a>Madison Square Garden Company and Anschutz Entertainment Group to Join Forces in Los Angeles</h1><p>Madison Square Garden Company (NYSE:MSG) and Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) are pleased to announce that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which MSG will become a 50% owner of AEG’s LA Lakers, Kings, and Galaxy franchises, as well as AEG’s Staples Center and convention center business in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The all-cash transaction is valued at $2.6 billion, including the assumption of debt. Under the terms of the agreement, MSG will also gain operational control of the franchises and venues.</p>
<p>“This landmark transaction is an important step in our ongoing strategy to drive long-term value for our shareholders by diversifying our business into high-growth sports and entertainment properties,” said Jim Dolan, CEO of Madison Square Garden Company.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with AEG and its world-class organization to create even more opportunities for fans in one of the most important markets in the world,” he added.</p>
<p>The move expands MSG’s footprint in California - where it already owns The Forum in Inglewood - and cements its presence in one of the world’s key growth markets for live sports and entertainment. It also further diversifies MSG’s business away from its core venue operations in New York City.</p>
<p>AEG will continue to own and operate its other sports franchises, venues, and related businesses globally. Financial advisors for this transaction were PJT Partners and Barclays.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Anschutz-and-Simon-Fuller-Form-Super-Team-in-London"><a href="#Phil-Anschutz-and-Simon-Fuller-Form-Super-Team-in-London" class="headerlink" title="Phil Anschutz and Simon Fuller Form Super Team in London"></a>Phil Anschutz and Simon Fuller Form Super Team in London</h1><p>Phil Anschutz, the billionaire behind AEG, and Simon Fuller, the creator of American Idol, have joined forces to create a new sports and entertainment venture in London. The new company, called All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club Limited, will own and operate The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), the home of Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Anschutz and Fuller were already partners in LA 2028, the group that won the right to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “We are very excited to be partnering with Simon on this new venture,” said Anschutz. “He is a world-renowned entrepreneur and I know his passion for excellence will be evident in everything we do at The All England Club.”</p>
<p>The AELTC was founded in 1868 and is one of the most prestigious clubs in the world. It has a long history of hosting major sporting events, including Wimbledon, which first started being played there in 1877. “The All England Club is one of the most iconic sports venues in the world,” said Fuller. “I am delighted to be able to work with Phil and his team to help take it to even greater heights.”</p>
<p>The new company will be chaired by Anschutz with Fuller serving as CEO. They are both committed to ensuring that the AELTC remains one of the premier sporting destinations in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Guggenheim-Partners-and-Golden-Tree-Asset-Management-to-Take-Over-Montreal-MLS-Franchise"><a href="#Guggenheim-Partners-and-Golden-Tree-Asset-Management-to-Take-Over-Montreal-MLS-Franchise" class="headerlink" title="Guggenheim Partners and Golden Tree Asset Management to Take Over Montreal MLS Franchise"></a>Guggenheim Partners and Golden Tree Asset Management to Take Over Montreal MLS Franchise</h1><p>Guggenheim Partners, a global investment and advisory firm, and Golden Tree Asset Management, a large credit hedge fund, have agreed to take over the Montreal MLS franchise. The takeover will provide the team with much-needed financial stability and resources as they continue to battle for a spot in the playoffs.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Guggenheim and Golden Tree,” said Montreal’s owner Andrew Wetenhall. “They are both world-class organizations with a proven track record of success. This partnership will allow us to continue to invest in our club and build a championship-caliber team.”</p>
<p>Heading up the new ownership group is Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter. “We are excited about this opportunity to invest in Montreal and help them compete at the highest level,” he said. “Our goal is to build a winning team that will make the city proud.”</p>
<p>Golden Tree Asset Management is led by Steven Tananbaum, who is also joining the Montreal ownership group. “This is an exciting opportunity to be involved in one of North America’s top soccer markets,” he said. “We look forward to working with the team’s fans, players, and staff to make Montreal a championship-caliber club.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Magnate-Sheldon-Adelson-to-Buy-Orlando-MLS-Club"><a href="#Casino-Magnate-Sheldon-Adelson-to-Buy-Orlando-MLS-Club" class="headerlink" title="Casino Magnate Sheldon Adelson to Buy Orlando MLS Club"></a>Casino Magnate Sheldon Adelson to Buy Orlando MLS Club</h1><p>Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is in talks to buy an expansion Major League Soccer club in Orlando, according to reports.</p>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/sports/soccer/mls-orlando-sheldon-adelson.html">New York Times</a>, the 84-year-old is in advanced negotiations with Orlando City SC owner Flavio Augusto da Silva about acquiring the team.</p>
<p>Adelson, who is worth an estimated $37.9 billion, is the founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, the largest casino company in the world. He also owns the newspaper <em>The Israel Hayom</em>.</p>
<p>If the deal goes through, it would make Adelson one of the biggest owners in MLS. He would join a group of billionaires including Stan Kroenke (LA Galaxy), Steve Kaplan (Atlanta United) and Jorge Mas (Miami FC).</p>
<p>Orlando City SC was founded as an MLS expansion team in 2010 and began play in 2015. The club has had mixed success on the pitch, making the playoffs twice but failing to win a game once they get there. They currently sit in 10th place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 6-7-1.</p>
<p>The club has been successful off the field, however, averaging crowds of over 27,000 per game at their 25,500-seat stadium. That figure ranks among the top five in MLS.</p>
