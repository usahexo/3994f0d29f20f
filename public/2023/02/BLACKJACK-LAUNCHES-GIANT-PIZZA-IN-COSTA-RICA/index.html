<h1 id="BLACKJACK-ANNOUNCES-GIANT-PIZZA-AVAILABILITY-IN-COSTA-RICA"><a href="#BLACKJACK-ANNOUNCES-GIANT-PIZZA-AVAILABILITY-IN-COSTA-RICA" class="headerlink" title="BLACKJACK ANNOUNCES GIANT PIZZA AVAILABILITY IN COSTA RICA"></a>BLACKJACK ANNOUNCES GIANT PIZZA AVAILABILITY IN COSTA RICA</h1><p>In an effort to expand their international reach, Blackjack Pizza has today announced the availability of their giant pizzas in Costa Rica. This move comes hot on the heels of their recent entrance into the Colombian market, and is expected to solidify Blackjack’s position as a leading global pizza provider.</p>
<p>The Costa Rican rollout will see Blackjack’s signature giant pizzas made available through a number of select local outlets. The move is being seen as a major win by the company, with CEO Ben Eriksen stating that “Blackjack Pizza is all about giving people more pizza for their money, and our giant pizzas are perfect for that. We’re excited to be able to offer them in Costa Rica, and we’re sure that locals and tourists alike will love them.”</p>
<p>Giant pizzas have proved popular in other markets where Blackjack has a presence, such as Chile and Peru, with customers enjoying the combination of great value and large serving sizes. The Costa Rican rollout will see three different giant pizza options available: the Meat Lover’s, Veggie Lover’s and Combo Lover’s. All three feature Blackjack’s special sauce, cheese blend and homemade dough.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of giant pizzas in Costa Rica, Blackjack is offering a free pizza when two are purchased. This offer is valid at participating outlets from now until August 31st 2017. For more information on blackjackpizza.com</p>
<h1 id="BLACKJACK-TAKES-OVER-THE-COSTA-RICAN-PIZZA-MARKET-WITH-GIANT-PIZZA"><a href="#BLACKJACK-TAKES-OVER-THE-COSTA-RICAN-PIZZA-MARKET-WITH-GIANT-PIZZA" class="headerlink" title="BLACKJACK TAKES OVER THE COSTA RICAN PIZZA MARKET WITH GIANT PIZZA"></a>BLACKJACK TAKES OVER THE COSTA RICAN PIZZA MARKET WITH GIANT PIZZA</h1><p>In an unprecedented move, Blackjack Pizza has announced its acquisition of the Costa Rican pizza market. The company, known for its large specialty pizzas, said the purchase will give it a foothold in Central America and help it expand into new global markets.</p>
<p>“This is an important strategic move for Blackjack Pizza,” said CEO Cameron Brannan. “With this acquisition, we will be able to offer our unique brand of oversized pizzas to consumers in Costa Rica and beyond.”</p>
<p>The company didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, but sources say Blackjack Pizza paid $10 million for the Costa Rican pizza market. That’s a small price to pay for a company that expects to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year.</p>
<p>Blackjack Pizza isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on the growth of the pizza market. dominos [Dominos], Papa John’s [Papa John’s], and Little Caesar’s [Little Caesars] are all expanding their operations abroad, and they’re not the only ones. In recent years, international chains like Pizza Hut [Pizza Hut], Domino’s Pizza [Domino’s Pizza], and Papa John’s have all made big moves into China.</p>
<p> So why is the pizza market growing so fast? One reason is that pizza is becoming more popular with adults. In fact, a recent study by NPD Group found that adults are eating more pizza than ever before. Another reason is that pizza is convenient and affordable. It’s a great meal for families or for groups of friends.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, one thing is clear: the pizza market is booming and there’s plenty of room for growth. Blackjack Pizza plans to take advantage of that growth by expanding its operations in Central America and other key global markets.</p>
