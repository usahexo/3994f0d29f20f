This is a basic guide to help you decide when and how much to bet with the hands you're dealt. Remember that there are no absolutes in poker - always use your best judgement and adjust accordingly. I recommend using this chart as a starting point, and then adjusting once you have a better understanding of the game.

As you can see, the strongest hands are at the top of the chart, and the weaker hands are at the bottom. You'll want tobet more with stronger hands, and less with weaker hands. For example, if you are dealt a pair of kings, you should bet most of your chips. However, if you're holding A-2 offsuit, you'll want to bet very little (if anything at all).

There are also some handy notes included on the chart. For example, pairs (especially high pairs) are strong hands that should be bet aggressively preflop. Ace-high is also a strong hand, but since it's not a pair it can be tricky to figure out how much to bet - in this case, I would recommend betting around 3/4 of your stack or more. The weakest hand on the chart is 2-7 offsuit, so you don't want to put too much money in play if you're holding this bad hand.

Hopefully this guide will help give you a little bit better idea of what hands to play and how much to bet when playing Texas Hold'em poker preflop. Always remember to use your best judgement - these guidelines are just that, guidelines!

#  Chart for what hands to bet in online poker revealed!

If you’re looking for the chart for what hands to bet in online poker, look no further!

There are a variety of charts that can help you determine whether or not to bet, and which hands to play preflop. But depending on your playing style, there may be slight variations to the chart that will work better for you.

The basic starting hand chart is as follows: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AKs.

From here, it’s important to remember the following:

· Suited hands are stronger than offsuit hands.

· Higher card combinations are stronger than lower card combinations.

That being said, if you don’t have one of the above hands, you should generally fold. There are exceptions to this rule – for example, if you hold 8♣9♣ and there are two hearts on the board (giving you two potential flush cards), you may want to consider calling a bet or even raising, especially if there are other players in the hand.







   But again, these situations should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The best way to become comfortable with which hands to play is simply by playing often and observing how other players bet. Remember – poker is a game of many different elements, including reading your opponents and bluffing when necessary!
