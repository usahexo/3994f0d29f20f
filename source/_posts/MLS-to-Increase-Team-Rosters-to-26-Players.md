#  MLS to Increase Team Rosters to 26 Players

On Wednesday, the MLS announced that it is increasing team rosters from 24 to 26 players. This change will take effect for the 2020 season.

"As our league continues to grow, it is important that we provide clubs with the necessary tools to succeed," said MLS Deputy Commissioner Mark Abbott in a statement. "This roster increase will give teams additional flexibility as they build their rosters."

The decision to increase team rosters comes as the MLS prepares for its 25th anniversary season. The league has seen continued growth in recent years, with new teams joining and average attendance reaching record levels.

Increasing team rosters from 24 to 26 players will give teams more flexibility when building their squads. It will also allow clubs to sign more international players.

"Clubs are always looking for ways to improve and this gives them more depth and better options when assembling their squads," said Sporting Kansas City Manager Peter Vermes. "It's also great news for our fans who want to see more high-quality soccer."

Not all teams are happy with the decision, however, as it could lead to increased competition for roster spots.

"There's going to be an awful lot of players vying for those last two spots on each roster," said New England Revolution President Brian Bilello. "It's going to make things even more competitive for everyone."

#  MLS Announces New Jersey Team for 2019 Season

The North American Soccer League (NASL) announced on Tuesday that a new team, to be known as the New Jersey club, will join the league for the 2019 season. This is in addition to the three teams - Miami FC, Jacksonville Armada, and New York Cosmos - that are set to join the league for the 2018 season.

The New Jersey club will be owned by Johnson Family Enterprises (JFE), a South Jersey-based holding company with over 35 years of experience in sports and entertainment. JFE's CEO, Darius Johnson, had this to say about the team: "We're excited to bring professional soccer to South Jersey and proud to be associated with NASL. Our ownership group is committed to building a first-class organization that will make our fans proud."

With regards to a name and logo for the team, those will be forthcoming at a later date. In an interesting twist, it was also announced that the New Jersey club will have a reserve side that will compete in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), America's fourth division. This should give local players in South Jersey an opportunity to play at a higher level and showcase their talents in front of the New Jersey club's coaching staff.

When asked about why they decided to invest in a professional soccer team, Darius Johnson had this to say: "We believe in the growth of soccer in North America, and more importantly we believe in our region. We are excited about bringing a top-level professional soccer experience to our fans and working with the NASL to help grow the sport locally."

The addition of another team brings NASL's total number of teams up to 12; with five more teams planned for 2020 (including one in Baltimore). This makes NASL one of the largest professional soccer leagues in North America - and one that is definitely on the rise.

#  Cincinnati Receives Franchise in Major League Soccer

Major League Soccer, the top professional soccer league in the United States and Canada, announced last week that Cincinnati will join the league as its 26th franchise. The announcement comes after years of deliberation on whether or not to bring an MLS team to Cincinnati.

 MLS Commissioner Don Garber cited the city's impressive fan base and successful bids for other major sporting events as reasons for awarding Cincinnati a franchise.

"I'm really excited about it," said Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley. "We've had great success with our other teams, and I think this is going to be another anchor institution that helps make Cincinnati one of the premiere sports cities in America."

The new team, which does not yet have a name, will begin play in 2019 at a still undetermined venue. FC Cincinnati, a United Soccer League (USL) team which plays its home games at Nippert Stadium on the University of Cincinnati campus, is widely expected to be named the MLS team's affiliate.

FC Cincinnati has averaged more than 21,000 fans per game during its two seasons in the USL, making it one of the most popular teams in the country outside of MLS. The club has also been successful on the field, reaching the semifinals of the US Open Cup last year.

Local business leaders are already anticipating major benefits from having an MLS team in Cincinnati. "It'll be huge for us," said Jill Meyer, president and CEO of CincyUSA, a regional consortium of tourism businesses. "We're really looking forward to working with them to help drive visitation to our region."

With a population of over 2 million and a thriving economy, Cincinnati was seen as a logical choice for an MLS expansion team. And while there are still some details to iron out, such as the team's name and stadium location, there is no doubt that soccer is now firmly established as a major sport in America's heartland.

#  Detroit awarded 2020 MLS expansion team

After months of speculation and deliberation, the MLS announced on Tuesday that Detroit would be awarded one of the two expansion teams up for grabs. The other team will go to Nashville.

The Motor City has long been seen as a prime candidate for a MLS team, with its large and passionate fan base. The city has also seen a resurgence in recent years, with a downtown renaissance spurred on by the development of new sports venues like Little Caesars Arena.

“It’s spectacular news,” said Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores, who was part of the expansion bid committee. “We have waited so long for this and it’s finally coming to fruition. To bring Major League Soccer to Detroit is a dream come true for all of us.”

The 2020 season will be the 25th for MLS, which has seen impressive growth in recent years. The league currently boasts 23 teams, with plans to expand to 28 teams in the near future.

#  Miami granted final slot in Major League Soccer

Miami, Florida has been announced as the recipient of the 23rd and final slot in Major League Soccer. The league, which has been expanding rapidly in recent years, had been searching for a new home for its Miami team after David Beckham failed to secure a stadium deal.

Miami's entry into MLS will bring the number of teams in the league to 24, and gives the Floridian city its long-awaited major league sports franchise. Beckham, who is part-owner of the new Miami club, is expected to be involved in running the team.

The addition of Miami means that all 50 states will be represented in MLS - a first for any American professional sports league. This milestone was hailed by MLS Commissioner Don Garber as "a testament to soccer's growing popularity in this country."

"This is a historic day for Major League Soccer and our terrific partners at Miami-Dade County," Garber said in a statement. "We are thrilled to welcome Miami to MLS and incredibly excited about their plans for an iconic waterfront stadium."

Miami's entry into MLS had been met with some opposition from fans of other teams in the league, who were concerned that the new club would playoff spots and/or broadcasting revenue. However, these concerns seem to have been assuaged by MLS' decision to expand by only one team (rather than the two that had initially been proposed).

"I'm happy it's just one team," said Sporting Kansas City fan Josh Heitkamp. "I don't think it'll take away from anyone else's experience."

With Miami now confirmed as an MLS city, attention will turn to which players will join Beckham on the new club's roster. Speculation is already rife about potential signings, with Brazilian superstar Neymar being mentioned as a possible target.
