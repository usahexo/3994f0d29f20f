#  How to Cash Out on Stop Clash Cameroon 

The Stop Clash Cameroon initiative was created to help Cameroonians living in the diaspora send money to their loved ones back home. The service offers a way for people to receive money without having to go through a traditional bank.

So how does it work?

Stop Clash Cameroon is a cash-out system that allows users to exchange their foreign currency for Central African Francs. The service is available in select countries, and those looking to use it must have an account with one of the partner banks.

Once you have an account with a partner bank, you can then begin exchanging your currency. To do this, simply visit a participating merchant and provide them with the amount of money you would like to exchange. They will then provide you with Stop Clash Cameroon vouchers which you can use to withdraw cash from any ATM in Cameroon.

It’s important to note that there are limits on how much money you can exchange per day. For example, you can only exchange up to 3,000 Euros per day.

The service is currently available in the following countries:

How does Stop Clash work for merchants?
