#  MLS Cup champions crowned

A rematch of the 2016 MLS Cup final saw Toronto FC crowned the champions of MLS after a 2-0 victory over Seattle Sounders.

Jozy Altidore and Michael Bradley both found the net in an impressive team performance, with goalkeeper Alex Bono coming up with some big saves to keep a clean sheet.

Toronto had to weather an intense Sounders onslaught in the second half, but held on to make history as the first Canadian team to win MLS Cup.

The celebrations were wild in Toronto, and Bono was carried off the field by his jubilant teammates after the final whistle.

It’s been a long journey for Toronto FC, who have now won every domestic title available to them.

 striking duo of Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco, who were both pivotal in Toronto’s championship run.

Altidore finished the season with 17 goals in 28 appearances, while Giovinco added 16 goals and 15 assists.

With such firepower at their disposal, it’s no wonder Toronto topped the Eastern Conference table during the regular season.

#  Seattle Sounders take home MLS Cup for the first time

After a long and exciting MLS Cup final, the Seattle Sounders have been crowned champions for the first time in their history. The match was a close one, with both sides evenly matched, but the Sounders managed to score the only goal of the game and take home the trophy.

The victory is a historic one for Seattle, and it caps off an impressive season for the club. They were by far the best team in the MLS this year, and they proved it by winning the Cup in decisive fashion.

This victory is also a huge moment for Sigi Schmid, who has been with the Sounders since their inception and has now finally won an MLS Cup championship. Schmid is one of the most successful coaches in American soccer history, and this victory is sure to cement his legacy as one of the greats.

All in all, it was an amazing season for Seattle Sounders FC, and they can now proudly call themselves champions of Major League Soccer.

#  Toronto FC knocked out of playoffs in semi-final round

It was a disappointing end to the season for Toronto FC who were knocked out of the playoffs in the semi-final round. The team battled hard but fell short against rivals Montreal Impact.

Toronto had high hopes coming into the playoffs after a strong regular season, but they were unable to get past Montreal. The Impact scored early in both legs of the semi-final and held on for the win.

This was a tough loss for Toronto, but they can take some positives away from their 2017 campaign. The team showed great resilience throughout the season and will be even stronger next year.

Overall, it was a successful year for Toronto FC. They reached the playoffs for the seventh consecutive year and advanced further than ever before. There is still plenty of work to be done, but the future looks bright for this talented squad.

#  Vancouver Whitecaps bow out in Conference semifinal

For the second season in a row, Vancouver Whitecaps bowed out of the MLS Cup Playoffs at the Conference semifinal stage. A 2-0 loss to Seattle Sounders on Thursday night means that the Whitecaps will not be going to their first MLS Cup Final.

It was always going to be a difficult task for Vancouver to overcome Seattle, who finished third in the Western Conference with 57 points, compared to the Whitecaps’ 46 points. But it was still disappointing for fans of the club to see them lose in such an unspectacular fashion.

The game started poorly for Vancouver, as they conceded just two minutes in. A cross from Cristian Roldan found its way to Nicolás Lodeiro at the back post, and he made no mistake with his finish. The Sounders then doubled their lead in the 39th minute, as Clint Dempsey converted a penalty after Lodeiro was brought down in the area by Kendall Waston.

There was very little chance of a comeback from there for Vancouver, and they failed to create any clear-cut chances in the second half. The only positive for them was that Seattle were unable to add to their lead, meaning that the final scoreline remained 2-0.

This offseason is sure to be an important one for Vancouver Whitecaps. They will need to make some big changes if they are to compete for silverware next season, and hopefully they can get off to a better start than they did this year.

#  Montreal Impact eliminated from playoffs in quarterfinal

The Montreal Impact were ousted from the MLS playoffs Wednesday night, losing 5-4 on aggregate to the New York Red Bulls in the quarterfinals.

Montreal had a chance to advance to the semifinals with a win at home in the second leg of the series, but fell behind 2-0 early and could not make up the deficit.

The Impact were one of six teams to make the playoffs in both of MLS' first two seasons.
