### How do I play?

Playing No-Commission VIP Speed Baccarat is easy – all you need to do is choose your bet amount and then hit the ‘deal’ button. The Dealer will then deal two cards face up to each player and one card face down to themselves. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to 9 points, with cards worth face value (2 through 10) counting as their point value, and an ace counting as 1 point or 11 points. The highest hand wins – so if you have a hand worth 8 points, for example, you would lose to a hand worth 9 points.

However, if either player has a total hand value of 8 or 9 points (a ‘natural’), that player automatically wins and no further cards are drawn. Likewise, if the Dealer has a total hand value of 8 or 9 points (a ‘natural’), that player automatically loses. In all other cases, both players draw another card in order to determine their final score.

### What are the stakes?

The stakes in No-Commission VIP Speed Baccarat are simple – just select your bet amount and you’re good to go! You can bet anywhere from £1/$1 up to £100/$100 per hand, so there’s something for everyone regardless of how much money they want to wager. Simply choose your bet amount and hit the ‘deal’ button – it’s that easy!
