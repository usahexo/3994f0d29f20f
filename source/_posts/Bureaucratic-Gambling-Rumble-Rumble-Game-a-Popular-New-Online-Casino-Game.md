#  Bureaucratic Gambling Rumble Rumble Game a Popular New Online Casino Game

## Introduction

The Bureaucratic Gambling Rumble Rumble Game is one of the newest and most popular online casino games. The game, which is a combination of roulette and blackjack, takes only a few minutes to learn but offers hours of entertainment.

## How to Play

To play the game, you first need to place your bet. You can choose from one of four betting options: black, red, odd, or even. After you have placed your bet, the dealer will deal out two cards to each player and two cards to themselves. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If your total score is higher than the dealer's total score, you win! If your score is lower than the dealer's, you lose.

If both you and the dealer have the same score (e.g. 17), it is called a "push" and no one wins or loses money. In addition, if you have an ace and a 10 value card (e.g. jack, queen, or king), this is called a "blackjack" and beats all other scores except for a pure 21 (which would be three 7s).

The table below shows all the possible outcomes in a game of Bureaucratic Gambling Rumble Rumble:

An interesting feature of this game is that it does not use standard deck of 52 cards. The game uses a special deck consisting of only 16 cards: 2 each of Aces, 2s through 9s, and 3 each of 10s through Kings. This makes the odds slightly different from traditional blackjack or roulette games.
