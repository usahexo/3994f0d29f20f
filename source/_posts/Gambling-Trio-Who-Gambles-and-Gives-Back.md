#  Gambling Trio Who Gambles and Gives Back

In any city or town there are always a trio of people who can be found at the gambling tables. The first is the retired person who has time on their hands and likes to gamble for the fun of it. The second is the working person who gambles to make money. And lastly, the person who gambles to lose money. While these three types of gamblers exist in any city or town, there are also those who give back to their community in one way or another.

One such trio can be found in Atlantic City, where they were recently profiled in an article in The Press of Atlantic City. The first member of the trio is 75-year-old Marilyn Kaplan, a retired teacher and bookkeeper from Egg Harbor Township. Marilyn has been gambling at the casinos in Atlantic City for over 25 years and says she enjoys playing blackjack and roulette for the fun of it.

The second member of the trio is 41-year-old Teresa Hillebrand, a single mother from Pleasantville who works as a certified nursing assistant. Teresa started gambling when she was 18 years old and does it mainly to make money. She often travels to Atlantic City from her home in Pleasantville, which is about a 45-minute drive away, to play blackjack and poker.

The third member of the trio is 60-year-old Carmen Giglio from Egg Harbor Township, who describes herself as a “professional loser”. Carmen has been gambling for over 30 years and began losing money when she started playing blackjack. She now mainly gambles on slot machines, and often visits the casinos in Atlantic City 3 or 4 times a week.

While each of these three gamblers has their own reasons for gambling, they all share one common goal: to help support their families. Teresa Hillebrand says that she often uses her winnings to help pay bills and put food on the table for her two children, while Carmen Giglio says that she uses her gambling losses to supplement her income as a part-time administrative assistant. Marilyn Kaplan also uses her gambling winnings to help support her family, including her son who is currently battling cancer.

Despite their different motivations for gambling, all three women say they enjoy giving back to their communities in one way or another. For example, Teresa Hillebrand volunteers with Meals on Wheels and helps organize food drives for local shelters, while Carmen Giglio regularly donates blood plasma and has even volunteered as a literacy tutor. Marilyn Kaplan is also active in her community, serving as treasurer of her homeowners association and helping out at fundraising events for various charities.

So whether you’re a retiree looking for something to do, a working person trying to make ends meet, or just someone looking for a way to lose some money, be sure to check out these three amazing women who gamble and give back!

#   trio who gives back to people who were ribbed 

In this ever-changing and dog-eat-dog world, it’s nice to know there are still people who care and give back to others. Meet the trio of sisters – Andrea, Brooke, and Carley – who have been doing just that since they were young girls.

The sisters grew up in a small town where almost everyone knew each other. And when someone was down, the sisters were always there to pick them up. Whether it was through a kind word or deed, the sisters never hesitated to help those in need.

That trait continued as they got older and entered into the working world. Throughout their careers, the sisters have helped countless colleagues and friends who have gone through rough patches. They’ve given their time, energy, and resources to help others get back on their feet.

The sisters’ generosity knows no bounds. In fact, they often go above and beyond for the people they care about. For example, Brooke once drove two hours out of her way to bring food to a friend who was going through a tough time. Andrea has helped friends move across the country and even build their businesses from scratch. And Carley has been known to cook meals for friends who are under the weather.

The trio’s biggest passion, however, is giving back to kids who have been bullied. They know what it’s like to be picked on and ridiculed, so they do everything they can to support kids who are going through a tough time. Whether it’s raising money or awareness for anti-bullying organizations or simply lending an ear, the sisters are always there for kids who need it most.

So if you ever find yourself feeling down, remember that there are people in this world who care about you – people like the trio of sisters Andrea, Brooke, and Carley.
