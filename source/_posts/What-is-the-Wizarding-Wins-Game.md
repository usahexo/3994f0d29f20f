#  What is the Wizarding Wins Game?

The Wizarding Wins Game is a new, interactive experience that allows Harry Potter fans to immerse themselves in the wizarding world. The game allows players to choose from one of four Hogwarts houses, and compete in various tasks in order to gain points for their house. Some of the tasks include brewing potions, casting spells, and exploring the wizarding world.

#  How to win Wizarding Wins Game?

In Wizarding Wins, players are tasked with building the best magic academy. To do this, players must strategically place their professors and students in various classrooms. There are four things to consider when placing your pieces:

- Which professor should I choose for this course?

- What level should this student be?

- What room should this classroom be in?

- Which courses should I offer at my academy?

Choosing a Professor --------------------------

When choosing a professor, you want to think about the strengths and weaknesses of each character. Some professors are better at teaching certain subjects than others. For example, Hagrid is great at teaching Care of Magical Creatures, but he isn’t as good with Defence Against the Dark Arts. You also want to think about what kind of personality the professor has. Some professors might be more strict and demanding while others might be more laid back. It is important to choose the right professor for the right course so your students can learn as much as possible.

Leveling Students -------------------------

You also need to think about what level to put each student in. If you put them in too high of a level, they will have a hard time passing and if you put them in too low of a level, they will not learn anything new. You want to find that sweet spot where they can pass the class but still learn something new. You can either do this by trial and error or by using the wizarding world’s Official Student Level Guide (which can be found online). Just be sure to keep track of which students are in which classes so you don’t mix them up later on.
*Tip: Try not to put all your high level students in one class or all your low level students in another class. This will make it difficult for both groups to pass their courses.*
Room Selection -------------------------
Once you know which professor is teaching which class and what the level of the student should be, you need to decide where the classroom should be located. Again, you want to think about what type of room would fit that particular course best. Are you looking for a room with lots of natural light or would a dark dungeon be more appropriate for Defence Against the Dark Arts? Be creative and have fun with it! Just make sure all your classrooms are different from one another so it doesn’t get confusing later on.Course Selection -------------------------Now that you have everything set up, it is time to decide which courses your academy will offer. This is where things can get tricky because you want to make sure there is something for everyone. Do you have a student who loves potions? Why not add Potions classes to your roster? Do you have a student who hates maths? No problem! There are plenty of other courses available that don’t require maths skills. The sky is the limit when it comes to creating your perfect academy!

#  Where to play Wizarding Wins Game?

However, with so many casinos now offering Wizarding Wins, it can be tricky to decide where to play. So, we have created this guide to help you find the best casino for you.

Firstly, you need to decide what is important to you when choosing a casino. Do you want a great selection of games? Do you want generous bonuses? Or do you want a casino with a fast withdrawal time? Once you have decided what is important to you, you can start looking at specific casinos.
