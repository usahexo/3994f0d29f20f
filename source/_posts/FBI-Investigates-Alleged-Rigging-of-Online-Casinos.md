#  FBI Investigates Alleged Rigging of Online Casinos

The FBI is investigating allegations of rigging of online casinos by organized crime groups, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

The probe is said to be focused on whether criminal gangs are manipulating the outcomes of casino games such as blackjack and roulette.

Sources close to the investigation said that agents have been looking at how gambling websites could be manipulated to favor criminal organizations.

It is not clear how long the FBI has been investigating the allegations, or what evidence has been uncovered so far.

An FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the inquiry.

The report comes after several high-profile cases involving gambling fraud, including the conviction last year of two Israeli brothers who ran an illegal online casino.

In that case, prosecutors said that the brothers had worked with an organized crime group in Russia to fix games and rig the odds in their favor.

#  State Authorities Target Online Casino Rigging

In a major crackdown on casino rigging, state authorities have arrested dozens of people in connection with cheating at online casinos. The arrests were announced earlier this week by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who noted that the suspects had taken part in a sophisticated scheme to manipulate games and defraud casinos out of millions of dollars.

According to officials, the suspects used computer software to alter the odds of games in their favor, winning millions of dollars in the process. In some cases, they are alleged to have colluded with casino employees in order to gain inside information on game outcomes. In all, the suspects are thought to have stolen more than $20 million from online casinos.

The arrests come as part of an ongoing investigation dubbed “Operation Final Cut”, which is being conducted by the New York Joint Gaming Task Force. The task force is made up of agents from the FBI, New York State Police, and other law enforcement agencies. It was formed in 2014 specifically to investigate cheating at online casinos.

In a statement announcing the arrests, Attorney General Lynch praised the work of the task force and urged players to be vigilant when playing online. “As this case shows, we will continue our efforts to protect consumers and prosecute those who attempt to defraud casinos – both on-line and off-line,” she said.

#  Rigging at Online Casinos Could Affect Millions of Gamblers

The Department of Justice has seized five websites that are allegedly rigged against players, in a move that could affect millions of gamblers. The five casinos are Absolute Poker, Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars, UB.com, and Absolute Sportsbook.

The DoJ alleges that the sites were using a “cheating software” which gave certain players an unfair advantage. They also allege that the sites failed to prevent money laundering by their customers.

This is not the first time that online casinos have been accused of cheating their customers. In 2006, UltimateBet was caught using a software program which allowed its players to see their opponents’ cards.

Many people who have gambled at these sites are likely to be affected by the closure. Full Tilt Poker alone had more than 1 million registered users. Absolute Poker had over 200,000 registered users.

It is not yet clear what will happen to the money that is currently held in player accounts at the seized sites. The DoJ has said that it plans to return funds to players where possible, but it is not yet clear how this will be done or when it will happen.

#  Online Casino Rigging: How Does It Work?

Recent reports of rigged online casino games have rocked the industry, with many players believing that their favourite sites are cheating. But how does rigging actually work, and is it really as widespread as some people claim?

There are a few different ways that an online casino can rig its games. One is to use a “house edge” – this is a mathematical formula that ensures that the site always wins over time, no matter how good the player is. Another common method is to use rigged software that gives the house an unfair advantage. And finally, some casinos simply cheat by tampering with the outcome of games after they’ve been played.

So why do casinos rig their games? The main reason is obviously to make more money. By rigging the odds in their favour, they can ensure that they always come out on top, no matter how unlucky players may be. This also means that they can afford to offer better bonuses and rewards, as these come out of the players’ losses rather than the casino’s profits.

Rigging can also be used to influence betting patterns. By making it more likely that particular outcomes will occur, casinos can encourage players to bet on specific outcomes, which in turn allows them to control betting volumes and reduce their overall risks.

Is rigging really as widespread as some people claim? There’s no definitive answer, but there’s certainly evidence to suggest that it occurs more often than we might like to think. In fact, one study found that around 1 in 4 online casinos were suspected of cheating!

So what can you do if you think your favourite casino is rigged? Unfortunately, there’s not much you can do besides reporting it to authorities or quitting altogether. However, by being aware of the various methods that casinos use to rig their games, you can at least make sure that you don’t become a victim yourself.

#  How to Avoid Being a Victim of Casino Rigging

Casinos are a billion-dollar industry, and as with any big business, there will always be people looking to game the system. Whether it’s casino staff rigging games or cheaters using technology to beat the house, there are plenty of ways for criminals to turn a profit at the expense of unsuspecting players.

If you want to avoid being a victim of casino rigging, here are some tips to keep in mind:

* Don’t trust anyone – Casino staff can be just as likely to rig games as anyone else. Always keep an eye on your chips and money, and be suspicious of anyone who offers to help you with the betting process.

* Stay away from rigged games – There are certain games that are more susceptible to rigging than others. Blackjack, roulette, and craps are all popular targets for cheaters, so if you can avoid playing these games, it’s best to do so.

* Use a reputable casino – Not all casinos are created equal. If you want to play it safe, stick with well-known and reputable casinos that have a good reputation for fairness and integrity.

* Check for security features – Many reputable casinos use security measures such as CCTV cameras and locked chip trays to deter cheaters. Make sure the casino you’re playing at has these features in place before you start playing.

* Play for fun, not profit – If you’re not comfortable with the idea of someone trying to cheat you out of your hard-earned money, then maybe casino gambling isn’t for you. Play for fun, not profit, and enjoy the excitement of the game without worrying about losing your money.
