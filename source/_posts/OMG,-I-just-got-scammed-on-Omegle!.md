#  OMG, I just got scammed on Omegle!

I was sitting in my chair, bored, when I decided to go on Omegle. I started talking to a guy named "Jake" and we were getting along well. Suddenly, he asked me to go to his paypal and send him money. I told him I didn't have any money, but he kept insisting. I finally gave in and sent him $10.

The next day, I checked my bank account and saw that he had stolen $100 from me! I was so angry and frustrated. I can't believe that someone would scam me like that on Omegle.

If you're ever talking to someone on Omegle and they ask you for money, be very careful. It could be a scammer trying to steal your hard-earned cash!

#  Why did my Omegle chat roulette session restart?

It can be really frustrating when your Omegle chat roulette session restart unexpectedly. This can be caused by a number of reasons, but some of the most common ones are:

* Your internet connection is weak or lost
 * You have been inactive on the site for too long
 * You have violated the site’s terms of service

If your chat restarted because of your internet connection, there isn’t much you can do except try to find a stronger signal or wait until it reconnects. If you think it might be because you were inactive, try to stay active on the site by talking to others and participating in conversations. If you think the reason might be because of violating the terms of service, make sure to read them carefully and follow all of the rules.

#  What do I do if my Omegle chat roulette doesn't work?

First, try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, you can try disabling your ad blocker (if you're using one) and reloading the page. If that still doesn't work, it may be an issue with your computer or browser. Try using a different browser or computer to see if the chat works. If it still doesn't work, please contact us and let us know.
